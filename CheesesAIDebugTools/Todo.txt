Todo:
	-Get auto switch to launched missile to work
		-Get missile always returns null, why?
	-Add the option to not switch the floating origin focus
	-Add mod debug
		-basically a modloader menu for pancake
	-MP Debug
		-lots of mp information would be nice to see
		-Maybe controls for the host?
	-More AI commands
		-Lots of these are tedious to add, im lazy
	-Mission editor debug
		-Allow the user to see triggers in a list and activate them manually?
	-Unit list
		-like BDA from back in the day :)
